# spotify-playlist-manager
First goal is to make a spotify dedup copy to manage some of my large playlists that have duplicates. Once working I'll add other features
Main.py can now grab the first 10 liked songs on my account. Keeping main.py in .gitignore for now so I don't accidentally push my secret key
